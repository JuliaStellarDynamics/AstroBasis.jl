# AstroBasis.jl

*Bi-orthogonal bases for galactic dynamics in Julia*

AstroBasis.jl implements several common basis sets (see 'Bases') in galactic dynamics, with a common interface (see 'Common Interfaces'). A quickstart is availabe, which will walk you through how to construct an image of the basis sets.
